# Hosting and extracting tarballs

Tarhosting, is a simple way to take compressed tarballs and host their
content.  This is designed to be a quick and easy solution to present
CI docs and test results inside of CI.

# Docker Quickstart
```
docker run -d -v /srv/docker/tarhosting:/static -p 6080:80 terzom/tarhosting
```

# API

## Get
To retrieve data publish
```
curl http://<host>:<port>/static/<directory>/path
```

## POST /deploy
Publish a tarball.

To publish static content stored in `html.tgz` and deploy it to the directory
abc.

```
curl -X POST -F file=@html.tgz http://localhost:5000/deploy/abc
```

This can also be publish into a sub directory

```
curl -F file=@html.tgz http://localhost:5000/deploy/abc/def/ghi
curl http://localhost:5000/static/abc/def/ghi/index.html
```

## GET /undeploy
To clean up directories use undeploy.  This is a recursive operation, so it will
start at top level.

```
curl http://localhost:5000/undeploy/abc/def/ghi
```

# Gitlab CI integration
This is the entire purpose to deploy documentation and test results from CI.  This service is provided with
pages inside of gitlab which is a really nice feature. Though if you running CE you don't have that option to host content.
